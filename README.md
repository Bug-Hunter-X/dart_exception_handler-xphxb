# Dart: Rethrowing Exceptions for Centralized Error Handling

This example showcases a common yet often overlooked practice in Dart asynchronous programming: rethrowing exceptions.

The `fetchData` function demonstrates how to handle potential errors during an HTTP request.  A `try-catch` block captures exceptions, prints an error message, and then uses `rethrow` to pass the exception up the call stack.  This enables higher-level functions to handle errors in a more centralized manner, perhaps logging the error, implementing retry logic, or presenting a user-friendly message.

**Why Rethrow?**

Simple `catch` blocks often only log errors locally.  Rethrowing allows a parent function or a global error handler to deal with it appropriately, which is particularly useful in larger applications.  Imagine a situation where multiple asynchronous operations might failâ€”rethrowing provides a unified way to manage these failures.

**Improvements in the Solution:**

- The `bugSolution.dart` file will illustrate a better approach to handling these errors.  We will discuss creating a custom exception class for better error reporting and handling.
